# Executive Summary of the EU AI Act

The European Commission has proposed a comprehensive regulation for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in the European Union (EU). The proposal aims to balance the socio-economic benefits of AI with potential risks, ensuring AI systems are safe, respect fundamental rights, and provide legal certainty for investment and innovation.

## Key Provisions

1. **Risk-Based Approach**: The proposal adopts a risk-based approach, categorizing AI systems into three risk levels: unacceptable, high, and low or minimal. Certain AI practices are prohibited due to their potential to violate fundamental rights. High-risk AI systems are subject to specific requirements and obligations, including data handling, transparency, human oversight, and robustness.

2. **Governance System**: The proposal establishes a governance system at Member State level and a European Artificial Intelligence Board at Union level. It also supports innovation through AI regulatory sandboxes and measures to reduce regulatory burden on SMEs and start-ups.

3. **Transparency Obligations**: AI systems interacting with natural persons or generating content should have specific transparency obligations. Providers of high-risk AI systems should register their systems in an EU database.

4. **Conformity Assessment**: High-risk AI systems must undergo a conformity assessment before being put on the market. They should bear the CE marking for conformity and free movement within the internal market.

5. **Regulatory Sandboxes**: Regulatory sandboxes should be established for testing innovative AI systems. In the sandbox, personal data collected for other purposes can be processed for developing and testing AI systems under certain conditions.

6. **Penalties for Non-Compliance**: The legislation outlines the administrative fines for non-compliance with AI regulations. Fines can reach up to 30 million EUR or 6% of a company's total worldwide annual turnover.

## Amendments to Existing Legislation

The proposal also includes amendments to various EU regulations and directives. When adopting delegated or implementing acts related to AI systems, which are considered safety components, the requirements outlined in Title III, Chapter 2 of the new Regulation on Artificial Intelligence must be considered.

## Review and Implementation

The Regulation will be effective 20 days after its publication and will apply 24 months after its enforcement. The Commission will submit a public report every four years, starting three years after this Regulation's application, evaluating its implementation. If needed, the Commission may propose amendments to the Regulation.
