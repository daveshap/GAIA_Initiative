# Executive Summary

This document provides policymakers with concrete recommendations for managing the risks associated with advanced AI systems. The rapid development of AI poses significant dangers, including the spread of misinformation, amplification of biases, concentration of power, and threats to national security. To address these risks, the Future of Life Institute recommends the following policy actions:

1. **Mandate robust third-party auditing and certification** for high-risk AI systems to ensure their safety and ethical compliance before deployment.

2. **Regulate organizations' access to computational power** by requiring a comprehensive risk assessment before granting access to large amounts of compute, and monitoring the use of compute in data centers.

3. **Establish capable AI agencies at the national level** to consolidate expertise, monitor AI progress, conduct impact assessments, and enforce regulations.

4. **Establish liability for AI-caused harm** by holding developers and deployers of high-risk AI systems strictly liable for resulting harms, and allowing joint and several liability for authorized deployments.

5. **Introduce measures to prevent and track AI model leaks** by mandating watermarking of AI models to protect against unauthorized distribution and enable legal action against leakers.

6. **Expand technical AI safety research funding** to ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a safe and secure manner, with a focus on alignment, robustness, and explainability.

7. **Develop standards for identifying and managing AI-generated content and recommendations** to distinguish between real and synthetic media, ensure transparency in AI interactions, and prevent conflicts of interest.

By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can establish a strong governance foundation for AI and mitigate the risks associated with advanced AI systems. The coordinated efforts of civil society, governments, academia, industry, and the public are crucial to realizing the benefits of AI while ensuring its responsible development and use.
