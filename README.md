### 2023-06-14 - EU AI Act

TLDR: The [EU AI Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206) is in the works. It's a sweeping and comprehensive proposed legislation that focuses on classifying AI into several categories (unacceptable uses, high risk uses, and low risks). The central idea is to prevent businesses and governments from engaging in unacceptable uses of AI (such as a social credit and surveillance system) and to strongly regulate high risk cases (life and death, justice, rights).
